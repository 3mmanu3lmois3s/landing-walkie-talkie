  "impact.modal.jobs_direct.title": "How are direct jobs estimated?",
  "impact.modal.jobs_direct.content": "Based on the projection of 12.8 million nodes over 10 years.\nEach node creates direct technical jobs for installation, maintenance, and support.\n\nCalculation: 12.8M nodes × 0.055 people ≈ 700,000 direct jobs.",

  "impact.modal.jobs_indirect.title": "How are indirect jobs estimated?",
  "impact.modal.jobs_indirect.content": "For each direct job, ~5 indirect jobs are generated in sectors such as transport, logistics, education, legal, energy, and support.\n\nFormula: 700,000 direct jobs × 5 = 3.5M indirect jobs.",

  "impact.modal.sectors.title": "Which sectors are considered strategic?",
  "impact.modal.sectors.content": "Education, agriculture, healthcare, civil defense, cybersecurity, transport, logistics, software, AI, energy, telecommunications, research, light industry, emergencies, public administration, local governments, NGOs, mining, construction, urban services, smart cities.",

  "impact.modal.economic.title": "How is the economic impact calculated?",
  "impact.modal.economic.content": "An average return of €250/year per node is estimated, including hardware, services, and licensing.\n\nComponents per node/year:\n🔧 Hardware: €60\n👨‍🔧 Services: €80\n💻 Software/Licenses: €30\n🔄 Evolution (AI, infrastructure, satellites...): €40\n📡 Energy & logistics: €40\n\nFormula: 12.8M nodes × €250/year = +€3.2B/year\n\n📘 Note: This estimate is inspired by Total Economic Return (TER) models used by the OECD, World Bank, and distributed telecom network impact studies.",

  "impact.modal.nodes_installed.title": "Why 12.8 million nodes in 10 years?",
  "impact.modal.nodes_installed.content": "Gradual adoption projection: family LANs, schools, governments, NGOs, companies, rural regions.\n\nConservative goal: 1 node per 600 people in critical or institutional environments.\nEurope would contribute ~15% of the total: +1.9M nodes.",
